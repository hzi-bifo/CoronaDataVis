Visualization and statistics of SARS-Cov2 data

## Data source

The metadata of SARS-Cov2 genome sequences was downloaded from GISAID and the time series cases data were from https://systems.jhu.edu/research/public-health/ncov/

### Note

The `prepare_data.sh` does not suport retrieving the sequence metadata any longer. It should be downloaded directly from GISAID.
